    p Welcome to Sparky - a static site generation tool created with one purpose, to help developers build awesome static websites with ease. Sparky was built by a collection of freelance developers to assist with the development of static websites that were required within tight deadlines.

    p Sparky is a lightweight collection of tasks which run within a gulpfile, these tasks are responsible for retrieving UI dependencies, compiling SCSS code to CSS, creating static article pages and many more. All of these tasks give you enough power to create a basic static website or even a blog!

    h2.code ## Features

    p At the time of building Sparky, I (Jamie) was preparing myself for a new Front End Developer position. The company which I was going to work for were building their websites with Ruby on Rails. As a result the majority of their websites were created with a templating language called Haml. You may or may not be aware, but the Jade (or Pug) templating language is heavily influenced by Rails' Haml partner.
