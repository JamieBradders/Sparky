# Sparky ⚡️

## This is my static site tool (built with Gulp.js)

### Getting Started
Clone the repo to your local machine and run `npm start`. This command will install the NPM dependencies, JSPM dependencies and run the initial Gulp command to build assets and bundle JSPM.

If all is well then run `gulp webserver` to kick start the local server, livereload is activated by default for you convenience. A watch command is also available and can be activated by running `gulp watch`.

### Issues
If you experience any issues then please raise them alternatively feel free to PR 😀
