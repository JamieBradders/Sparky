# Sparky ⚡️

## This is my static site tool (built with Gulp.js)

### Getting Started
Clone the repo to your local machine and run `npm start`. This command will install the NPM dependencies, JSPM dependencies and run the initial Gulp command to build assets and bundle JSPM.

If all is well then run `gulp watch` to kick start the local server, livereload is activated by default for you convenience, and watch files for changes. The watcher will ensure that only commands associated with the file that you have changed are executed.

### Issues
If you experience any issues then please raise them alternatively feel free to PR 😀
