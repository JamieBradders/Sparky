# Sparky

## This is my static site tool (built with Gulp.js)

#### To Do
- Construct a Bootstrap Configurator which builds up .scss files and allow easy customisation
- Jade has now moved and become Pug. The gulp-layout module currently does not support .pug file types. Therefore, article templates are built in .jade files, however, all other templates can use .pug - I'll keep an eye on this and update when the module is updated.

#### Update
To ensure sites are built to consistent standards I have included a scss-lint configuration file. The rules in this lint config adhere to the AirBnb CSS Styleguide - https://github.com/airbnb/css
